	Online Test Application 
Online test application is a technology driven way to simplify examination activities like defining exam pattern with question bank defining exam timer, objective question sections, conducting exam using the computer or mobile device in a paperless manner. 

In our proposed system, candidates can give different types of competitive exams using this application.

We have developed the web-application in following steps: - It starts with an interaction between user and local host. The local host will start the program, will take a user to exam portal, where the exam will be held and the exam result will display after the exam. The admin can manage the exam from admin exam portal.
